It provides several utilities for achieving a fixed state when testing Python programs. Specifically, these utilities setup / teardown databases and work with temporary file systems. This is useful for testing and came about to fulfill stories like these:

I want to load data into a test database and easily reference that data when making assertions.
I want data linked by foreign key to load automatically and delete without integrity error.
I want to reference linked rows by meaningful names, not hard-coded ID numbers.
I donâ€™t want to worry about auto-incrementing sequences.
I want to recreate an environment (say, for a bug) by querying a database for real data.
I want to test with files in a temporary, transparent file system.
